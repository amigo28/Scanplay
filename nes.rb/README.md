This is an insane attempt to re-create the NES CPU in Ruby. Why? Because. 

Seriously though, this is a port of the JSNES NES emulator to Ruby. I got through the CPU and PPU (Picture processing unit) before
. The PAPU is left to be finished. 

Have I tested this? No. It was a fun experiment to learn about low level hardware programming and software emulation of the 
6502 chip.
